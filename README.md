APK Studio is a cross-platform IDE for reverse-engineering (decompiling/editing) & recompiling of android application binaries within single user-interface. Unlike initial release being Windows exclusive & also didn’t support frameworks, this one is completely re-written using QT for cross-platform support. You can now have multiple frameworks installed & pick a particular one on a per project basis.
